## <a name="ins">1. Installation</a>
The IPython Notebook would require an environment with Python 3+ installed along with a software to execute IPython Notebooks. Required dependencies include Matplotlib.

## <a name="mot">2. Motivation</a>
Seeing the spread of COVID-19 in India, I was curious to see how the virus was affecting different states and how the states were dealing with the pandemic.
